                    <h3><li>Career Description</li></h3>
                    <p>Software engineers apply their knowledge in order to design and build programs suitable for networks, operating systems, databases, applications, and more. Using their knowledge on certain programming languages or development environments, they are able to apply logic and reasoning skills to find efficient solutions for programs. Many software engineers typically specialize in certain areas of development and certain languages. A typical work environment will most likely involve collaborating with other software engineers who specialize in different fields in order to build upon projects. I personally plan to specialize in applications, both on the front end, in which you focus on the overall design and user interface of an application, and on the back end, in which you may focus on managing databases.</p>
                    <h3><li>Educational Requirements</li></h3>
                    <p>Many software engineers must have at least a bachelors degree in computer science, math, science, software, or other closely relative majors and have experience and knowledge with computer systems and applications, in order to be employed. Depending on the certain area of development, it is also important that they be well-versed in any coding languages and concepts needed that area of development and across different platforms. Higher areas of expertise will also require at least a masters degree or certain certification.</p>
                    <h3><li>Key Skills</li></h3>
                        <ul>
                            <h4><li>Analytical skills</li></h4>
                            <p>A software engineer must have strong logic and reasoning skills in order to properly address problems and to pay attention to details; skills which are essential to software engineering..</p>
                            <h4><li>Cooperative</li></h4>
                            <p>They must have the capacity to to communicate and understand others, and work in a team. Many projects involving software engingeering requires teamwork.</p>
                            <h4><li>Self-awareness</li></h4>
                            <p>When working on projects, by yourself or others, it is important to be aware of the dynamics and roles one another has.</p>
                            <h4><li>Curiosity</li></h4>
                            <p>As software engineering is an ever changing field, as technology continues to improve, it is important that one has the capability and initiative to learn new concepts. </p>
                        </ul>
                    <p></p>
                    <h3><li>Job Outlook</li></h3>
                    <p>With the massive impact of technology today, jobs for computer science and software engineering have been increasing. Currently, there are more jobs available within the field than there are graduates. The employment of software engineers is estimated to grow by 24 from 2016 to 2026, faster than many other occupations. As the consumption of technology increases, so will the need for software engineers.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <h4<li>Salary</li></h4>
                        <p>The average salary of a software engineer accoring to computerscience.org, is $106,050. According to glassdoor, a job search website, the entry level salary is reported to be $94,550 after recording over 180,000 responses. One's salary largely depends on the company you work for and your position.</p>
                        <h4<li>Advancement</li></h4>
                        <p>As one gains more experience with software engineering, as will their advancement opportunities; as for those who are kept up to date with technology. More education and certification will allow you to advance into the field as well. In time, some software engineers may be promoted to managerial positions, overlooking the development of projects, or specialize even more into their respective area of development.</p>
