# WELCOME TO MY COOL WEBSITE 😎

Hey I'm Raphaelle Therese Guinanao (gee-nah-now), a dedicated software engineer with experience in Full-Stack Development and Embedded Systems. As a curious learner with a sense of initiative, I've tried to dabble in a little bit of everything from working in research, teaching, web/full-stack development, mixed reality, fintech, and defense and embedded systems. I'm known for delivering impactful results while being able to adapt and grow quickly through evolving situations by means of effective cross-team communication and strategic thinking.
