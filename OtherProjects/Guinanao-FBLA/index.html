                <h1>Resume And Forms</h1>
                <hr>
                <h2>Writing a resume</h2>
                <ol>
                    <h3><li>Choose a format</li></h3>
                        <p>There are typically three different types of formats when it comes to resumes. Choose whichever one that you believe will represent yourself and your job experience the best.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Reverse-chronological:</strong> This is typically seen as the traditional style of resume. Your information is displayed in a reverse-chronological format, which helps highlight your progress in certain occupations. This is preferred by many as it accommodates all industries and levels of experience. Although, it may not be beneficial for those who frequently change jobs or have gaps in their work history.</li>
                            <li><strong>Functional:</strong> This type of resume emphasizes your capabilities and qualifications. It's best used if you wish to highlight certain skill sets or if you have gaps and changes in your employment history.</li>
                            <li><strong>Combination:</strong> This type of resume is a combination of certain aspects of the chronological and functional formats. If you wish to highlight experience or a skill set in a certain career, or change career paths, this is the format for you.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h3><li>Add your information</li></h3>
                        <p>Keep in mind that the information you display and the order they are displayed in largely depend on the format you've chosen. The following are typical components of a resume.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> Every resume should have this section. Your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, and id possible, a link to your online portfolio, should be provided.</li>
                                <li><strong>Resume Introduction:</strong> There are 3 possible options you can choose as your resume introductions: a qualifications summary, career objective, and professional profile. Choose the one that you believe will best emphasize your abilities and goals.</li>
                                <li><strong>Professional Experience:</strong> This section is essential to your resume, as it outlines all of your previous work experience. Your work experiences should be listed in reverse chronological order, and only display work experiences that are in relevance to the job you are seeking. Make sure to state the company's name, location, date of employment, and your title. Also add a few bullet points of your duties and achievements.</li>
                                <li><strong>Education:</strong> This section displays your the extent of your knowledge and expertise. Make sure to include the name of the institutions you've gone to, the location of the school, date of graduation, your degree, and GPA.</li>
                                <li><strong>Additional Sections:</strong> By adding information relevant to your career, this may help strengthen your resume overall. Here you can list your certifications/licenses, publications, awards/honors/activities, technical skills, and additional skills.</li>
                            </ul>
                    <h3><li>Style your resume</li></h3>
                        <p>Taking that extra step to style your resume can help make a better overall impression. Try to keep your resume short and simple; only add information that you think is relevant and beneficial. As for fonts, make it simple and easy to read. Make sure to organize your resume into legible sections. Too many or too little page breaks may discourage some from reading your resume.</p>
                </ol>

                <h2>Writing a cover letter</h2>
                    <p>Your cover letter sets up the initial impression of your overall resume.</p>
                    <p>Every cover letter should begin with a header including your name, telephone number, email address, date, name of the hiring manager and their professional title, and the name and address of the company you are applying to. You can also include your home address, links to portfolios, social media accounts, and  etc. as long as it's kept professional.</p>
                     <p>Make sure to begin with a formal greeting directly to the hiring manager who'll read it. Introduce yourself, and argue why you are suited for the job. Use the cover letter to provide something about yourself that your resume can't describe, such as your personality, traits, skills, etc. This is also a good area to explain certain aspects of your resume.</p>
                     <p>Aside from the content, make sure the document <em>looks good</em>. Small details such as margins, font size, alignment can make a difference.</p>

                    <p>Plan out what you have to say beforehand. It's good to be prepared for any questions thrown at you. Go over common interview questions such as "Why do you want to work for us?" and "What are your strengths and weaknesses?" and plan out your response. You can even come up with your own questions and answer them yourself. Make sure to emphasize your skills and abilities, and how they would serve useful if you were to be employed. Do some research and find out as much as you can about the occupation and institution you are interviewing for. Wear the appropriate attire. When you first arrive, make sure to introduce yourself and offer to shake their hands. During the interview, focus on your qualifications and enthusiasm for the job. And, of course, mind your matters. Politeness and etiquette matters greatly during a job interview, and poor manners may cost you the job.</p>
                    <p>By doing all of this, you can present yourself as someone who is prepared and eager to take up the job, leaving a good first impression.</p>
