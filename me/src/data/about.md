# Intro

I am a software engineer with experience in Full-Stack Development and Embedded Systems. As a curious learner with a sense of initiative, I've tried to dabble in a little bit of everything from working in research, teaching, web/full-stack development, fintech, and defense and embedded systems. I am particularly interested in developing projects that have an impact on everyday people. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# I like

- Watching and analyzing movies (wannabe film buff)
- Reading comics
- Falling down the YouTube rabbit-hole
- Karaoke

<!-- # Fun facts

- I have a list of thousands of ideas, like creating matching bow ties for cats and humans.
- I almost always have a sketchbook with me and a [01 Sakura Pigma Micron Pen](https://www.sakuraofamerica.com/product/pigma-micron/).
- I can't locate every country on a map.
- I operate a [small angel fund](http://skepticalinvestments.biz/) with terrible returns.
- I break about 30 traffic laws on a [cruiser](https://landyachtz.com/boards/cruiser/), [onewheel](https://onewheel.com/products/xr), [bicycle](https://www.citibikenyc.com/), or [electric skateboard](https://boostedusa.com/collections/electric-skateboards/products/boosted-mini-x) every single day.
- I added this page because so many people complained that my site was just my resume. -->
