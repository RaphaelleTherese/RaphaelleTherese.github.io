As a curious learner with a sense of initiative, I've tried to dabble in a little bit of everything from working in research, teaching, web/full-stack development, mixed reality, fintech, and defense and embedded systems. I'm known for delivering impactful results while being able to adapt and grow quickly through evolving situations by means of effective cross-team communication and strategic thinking.\r\n\r\n# interestss \ud83d\udc96\r\n\r\n- \ud83c\udf7f Aspiring movie buff (avid letterboxd logger)\r\n- \ud83d\udcda Reading comic books/ graphic novels. superheroes, webtoons, manga\r\n- \u270f\ufe0f Daily grinds on NYT Games \r\n- \ud83d\udcfa Diving into YouTube rabbit-holes\r\n- \ud83c\udfa4 Karaoke \ud83d\udc83\r\n- \u2660\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2666\ufe0f\u2663\ufe0f freecell addict\r\n\r\n\x3c!-- # Fun facts\r\n\r\n- I have a list of thousands of ideas, like creating matching bow ties for cats and humans.\r\n- I almost always have a sketchbook with me and a [01 Sakura Pigma Micron Pen](https://www.sakuraofamerica.com/product/pigma-micron/).\r\n- I can't locate every country on a map.\r\n- I operate a [small angel fund](http://skepticalinvestments.biz/) with terrible returns.\r\n- I break about 30 traffic laws on a [cruiser](https://landyachtz.com/boards/cruiser/), [onewheel](https://onewheel.com/products/xr), [bicycle](https://www.citibikenyc.com/), or [electric skateboard](https://boostedusa.com/collections/electric-skateboards/products/boosted-mini-x) every single day.\r\n- I added this page because so many people complained that my site was just my resume. --\x3e\r\n",d=l.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,u=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return(0,c.jsx)(r.rU,(0,a.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,c.jsx)(o.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Raphaelle Guinanao",children:(0,c.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,c.jsx)("header",{children:(0,c.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,c.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,c.jsx)(r.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,c.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),(0,c.jsx)(s(),{source:l,renderers:{Link:u},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
