As a curious learner with a sense of initiative, I've tried to dabble in a little bit of everything from working in research, teaching, web/full-stack development, fintech, and defense and embedded systems. I am particularly interested in developing projects that have an impact on everyday people. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.\r\n\r\n# I like\r\n\r\n- Watching and analyzing movies (wannabe film buff)\r\n- Reading comics\r\n- Falling down the YouTube rabbit-hole\r\n- Karaoke\r\n\r\n\x3c!-- # Fun facts\r\n\r\n- I have a list of thousands of ideas, like creating matching bow ties for cats and humans.\r\n- I almost always have a sketchbook with me and a [01 Sakura Pigma Micron Pen](https://www.sakuraofamerica.com/product/pigma-micron/).\r\n- I can't locate every country on a map.\r\n- I operate a [small angel fund](http://skepticalinvestments.biz/) with terrible returns.\r\n- I break about 30 traffic laws on a [cruiser](https://landyachtz.com/boards/cruiser/), [onewheel](https://onewheel.com/products/xr), [bicycle](https://www.citibikenyc.com/), or [electric skateboard](https://boostedusa.com/collections/electric-skateboards/products/boosted-mini-x) every single day.\r\n- I added this page because so many people complained that my site was just my resume. --\x3e\r\n",c=l.split(/\s+/).map((e=>e.replace(/\W/g,""))).filter((e=>e.length)).length,d=e=>{let{...a}=e;return(0,o.jsx)(n.rU,{...a})},h=()=>(0,o.jsx)(i.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Raphaelle Guinanao",children:(0,o.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,o.jsx)("header",{children:(0,o.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,o.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,o.jsx)(n.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,o.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",c," words)"]})]})}),(0,o.jsx)(s(),{source:l,renderers:{Link:d},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}]);
